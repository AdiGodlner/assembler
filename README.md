## Overview

The Assembler project, developed as part of the Systems Programming Lab course in the open university of Israel ( course number : TODO ) , is a simplified assembler designed to translate assembly language code into binary instructions. The objective of the project is to bridge the gap between human-readable assembly code and machine-executable binary code.

Key features of the assembler include parsing and lexical analysis of assembly instructions, encoding assembly instructions into binary representations, and comprehensive error handling. The assembler facilitates low-level programming by enabling the execution of programs written in assembly language on target hardware.
